## Getting Started

There are many ways to get started and to test your application or tap into your own code repo. For this workshop we will provide two sample application and outline two ways to get started with protecting your serverless applications at runtime.  

- **PyGoat** will deploy a sample containerized, vulnerable application. View source [here](https://github.com/JustinDPerkins/pygoat-tm).

- **Vulnerable Serverless Application** will deploy a sample vulnerable application leveraging Amazon S3, Amazon API Gateway and Lambda. View source [here](https://github.com/JustinDPerkins/vulnerable-serverless-application-python).

Take note that the sample applications are sized to be up and running quickly. 

Let's get started :computer: :rocket:
