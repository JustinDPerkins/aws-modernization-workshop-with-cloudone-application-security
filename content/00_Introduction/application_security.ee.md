### What is Application Security?

Application Security is built for speedy deployment, with minimal impact on development streams and performance. It only takes a minute to add the library to your application, and there is no need to change your development code. Application Security bootstraps itself into your application at runtime, as opposed to an SDK that must be integrated into the application. You just need to include the Application Security library with your application and activate it with the application keys. This approach simplifies how security is delivered and is a significant shift for application developers who need immediate, real-time protection for their apps and customers.


Application Security minimizes design and deployment risks by protecting against sophisticated hacks from inside the application. Optimized for modern application architectures, Application Security immediately blocks unwanted activity in real time to protect data and business logic. The result is unprecedented protection, keeping web application owners and their users safe from hacks with the highest degree of accuracy

Application Security is based on runtime self-protection technology. The Application Security library is self-contained and independently protects its application, even if it becomes disconnected from the Application Security service. User data is never exposed outside the application, ensuring your apps remain compliant with data protection mandates
